# 🛡️ AWS VPC Practicals – Hands-on Network Configurations

This repository contains a set of **AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** projects that I completed while learning cloud. Each folder includes step-by-step setups of real VPC use cases to help me understand how networking works in AWS.

## 📌 Objective

The main goal of these practicals is to learn the basics of AWS VPC and related services by doing hands-on projects. As a fresher, I wanted to build my skills, understand key AWS components, and prepare myself for real-world cloud job roles.
